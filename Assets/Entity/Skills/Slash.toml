# These are main settings that declare our skill. Unless commented out as optional,
# these MUST exist in skill file to make it valid
[Main]
name = "Slash"

# Optional variable that make caster play certain animation on cast
caster_animation = "attack"
# Optional variable that overrides default animation speed of action above
# Idk if I should include it, to be fair
#caster_animation_speed = 1

# Amount of time, required to cast skill. Yes, its a different thing from cooldown.
# While active cooldown makes caster impossible to use skill again, cast_time timer
# makes caster impossible to use ANY skill. Also enforces caster to play cast
# animation for that much of a time, with rare exceptions (e.g getting damage)
cast_time = 0.5

# Skill's cooldown. Yes, its optional too, coz some skill may be spammed with no
# cd whatsoever. Or at least I think so... may change if it will break things
cooldown = 0.5

# Optional category that specifies projectile to be casted and its properties
[Projectile]
# Name of projectile. If doest exist, projectile wont be used
name = "Slash"
# Optional variable that overrides default scale of projectile's sprite
#scale = 1.5
# Optional variable that overrides default size of projectile's hitbox. Yep,
# these are two different things. I may rework that later, idk
#hitbox = 16
# Optional variable that sets projectile lifetime. If not set, projectile will
# stay on screen forever
lifetime = 0.1
# Projectile knockback. Knocks target furter from caster on collision with projectile
# Its optional too and I was tempting to put it onto stats, but for now that it
knockback = 0
# Optional variable that automatically rescale BOTH projectile's hitbox and sprite,
# in case caster's scale is different from 1. Can be true or false (default = false)
#scale_with_caster = true

[Stats]
# Optional category that define skill's stats. May not exist at all, if we are
# setting up a buff (for example).
# Just like category itself, all of the stats are optional, because, say, it
# makes no sense for buff to deal some damage, right?
#
# Skill's stats usually have following calculation formula:
#   int((stat + caster's stat) * multiplier)
# E.g, say, for skill with base dmg 5 and dmg multiplier 1.5, casted by character
# with dmg 10, damage will be (5+10)*1.5, rounded to int. E.g 22
#
# If stat isnt there, it gets threated as 0. HOWEVER, stat's MULTIPLIER has default
# of 1, UNLESS both multiplier and its stat are absent. Meaning:
#  - Skill with dmg of 1 and no dmg_multiplier will deal (1 + caster_dmg) * 1 dmg
#  - Skill with no dmg but dmg_multiplier set to ANYTHING (even the same 1), will
# deal (0 + caster_dmg) * 1 dmg
#  - Skill with both no dmg and no dmg_multiplier set will deal no damage at all

# Skill's damage
dmg = 0
# Damage multiplier
dmg_multiplier = 1

[Effects.caster]
# Effects are optional category for buffs and debuffs
# Its split into 2 subcategories with slightly different rules:
#  - [Effects.caster]. For effects that apply to whoever used skill. Gets applied
# right away, unless caster already have such effect active
#  - [Effects.target]. For effects that apply on whoever got affected by skill.
# Unlike above, this affects ONLY THOSE WHO TOUCH CASTER'S PROJECTILE. Meaning
# setting this without setting skill's projectile will have no effect

# Because right now I only have 'stun' being a thing, this is the only effect
# listed there. I wanted to add something else, but forgot about it, lol

# Length of effect
stun = 0.1

[Effects.target]
stun = 0.3
